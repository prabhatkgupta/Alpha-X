## Features

- 📊 Automatically fetches data from Google Forms responses
- 🎯 Tracks your 4 main goals: Career, Health, Marriage, Investments
- 🔧 **Flexible tracking** - works even if you remove columns (skip goals you don't track)
- 📱 Sends weekly insights via WhatsApp
- 🤖 Intelligent analysis and recommendations
- ⏰ Automated weekly reports every Sunday
- 📈 Detailed monthly summaries with trend analysis

## Goals Priority

1. **Career Growth** - Coding time, focus, and performance
2. **Health & Fitness** - Protein intake, workouts, sleep, sunshine
3. **Marriage** - Relationship goals tracking
4. **Investments** - (To be tracked)

**💡 Note**: All goals are optional! The system automatically adapts to whatever you track. Remove any columns from your form and the reports still work. See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for details.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Google Cloud account with Sheets API enabled
- Twilio account for WhatsApp messaging

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd Alpha-X

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

#### 1. Google Sheets API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Create credentials (Service Account):
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Fill in the details and create
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab > "Add Key" > "Create new key" > JSON
5. Download the JSON key file
6. Save as `credentials/google_sheets_credentials.json`
7. **Important**: Share your Google Sheet with the service account email (found in the JSON file under `client_email`)

#### 2. Twilio WhatsApp Setup

1. Sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. For development/testing:
   - Use Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp
   - Send "join <your-sandbox-code>" to +1 415 523 8886 from your WhatsApp
3. For production:
   - Apply for a WhatsApp Business API account
   - Get a WhatsApp-enabled phone number
4. Note your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console

#### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Google Sheets Configuration
GOOGLE_FORM_URL=your_google_form_url
GOOGLE_SHEET_URL=your_google_sheet_responses_file


# Twilio WhatsApp Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=whatsapp:+14155238886
YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+your_country_code_and_number
```

## Usage

### Quick Summary (Recommended)

**Weekly Summary** - Get summary of your last 7 entries:
```bash
python src/summarize_last_week.py
```
This automatically fetches the last 7 rows from your sheet, analyzes them, and sends insights to WhatsApp.

**Monthly Summary** - Get detailed analysis of last 30 days:
```bash
python src/summarize_last_month.py
```
Provides comprehensive monthly report with trends, week-over-week comparisons, and detailed insights.

### Manual Run

Generate and send weekly insights:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Generate insights for specific week:
```bash
python src/main.py --weeks-ago 1  # Last week's data
```

### Automated Weekly Reports

Run the scheduler (sends reports every Sunday at 1 PM):
```bash
python src/scheduler.py
```

**Want to set up automatic weekly summaries?** See [SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md](docs/SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md) for:
- Cron jobs (Mac/Linux)
- Task Scheduler (Windows)
- GitHub Actions (Cloud-based)
- Docker containers

### Test Connection

Test your setup:
```bash
python src/test_connection.py
```

## Development

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Lint Code

```bash
flake8 src/

```

## Customization

Want to track only certain goals? No problem!

- **Remove columns** from your Google Form - the system adapts automatically
- **Add custom goals** - see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md)
- **Rename sections** - update the config to match your needs
- The system **never crashes** due to missing columns

## Troubleshooting

### Google Sheets Access Denied

- Make sure you've shared the spreadsheet with the service account email
- Check that the Google Sheets API is enabled in your project

### WhatsApp Messages Not Sending

- Verify your Twilio credentials are correct
- If using sandbox, ensure you've joined the sandbox with your WhatsApp number
- Check your Twilio account balance (free account still works)

### No Data Found

- Verify the GOOGLE_SHEET_URL is correct
- Check that your sheet has data in the expected format
- Ensure the sheet name/tab is correct in the code

### "Not tracking X data" Messages

- This is normal if you removed columns from your form
- The system skips sections with no data automatically
- To start tracking, add the questions back to your form
